//Before the game begins have one player choose a random word in their head.
//Enter users word input
//Draw a game board using two vertical and two horizontal lines.
  //The board should look like an upsidedown capital T with a foot
//Player 2 guesses the letters that build Player 1's word.
  //If Player 2 guesses letter correct, then show correct letter
  //If Player 2 guesses letter wrong, then hide wrong letter and add body part to hangman
    //If hangman gets all body parts before the word is complete, Player 1 wins
    //If word is complete before hangman gets all body parts, Player 2 wins
