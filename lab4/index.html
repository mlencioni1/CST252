		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was focus building pseudocode in order to assist with
		problem-solving.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col" id=content>
		<h4>Challenges</h4>
		<p>My biggest challenge was detailing out the intructions without being too
			indepth or too vague. I also wanted to use terms (like If and Then) that
			could translated into JavaScript easier</p>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<h6>Pseudocode for How to Cook Pasta:</h6>
		<ol>
			<li>Get a pot of water</li>
			<li>Boil water on medium to high temperature</li>
			<li>Add Sea salt to the water</li>
			<li>Add box of penne pasta</li>
			<li>Set a timer for 10 minutes</li>
			<li>While the pasta waits on the 10 minute timer,
					Add oil, garlic, and diced onion into a saute pan</li>
			<li>Once the garlic and onion begin to brown, pour a can of crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce into pan.</li>
			<li>If sauce is boiling, then add half a can of tomato paste</li>
			<li>Add a pinch of salt, italian spice, oregeno, and sugar, then stir and let it sit for two minutes</li>
			<li>Stir, test, and strain pasta at the 10 minute mark, if pasta is al dente</li>
			<li>Mix strained penne pasta into saute pan with sauce</li>
			<li>Top off the pan with some parmesean and enjoy!</li>

		<h6>How to Create a Hangman Game:</h6>
		<ol>
			<li>Before the game begins have one player choose a random word in their head.</li>
			<li>Enter users word input</li>
			<li>Draw a game board using two vertical and two horizontal lines. <br>
			(The board should look like an upsidedown capital T with a foot) </li>
			<li>Player 2 guesses the letters that build Player 1's word.</li>
			<li>If Player 2 guesses letter correct, then show correct letter</li>
			<li>If Player 2 guesses letter wrong, then hide wrong letter and add body part to hangman</li>
			<li>If hangman gets all body parts before the word is complete, Player 1 wins</li>
			<li>If word is complete before hangman gets all body parts, Player 2 wins</li>
		</ol>
